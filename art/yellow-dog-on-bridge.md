  This piece was a nod to Jackson Pollock, although the end result is uniquely my style and not his. Funny how that happens. It's mixed media: Whatever paint I had lying around, mostly acrylic housepaint, but also some oils mixed in and covered with a few layers of varnish. This original has been sold.
