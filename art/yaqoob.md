  I painted this as a birthday gift for my father, Yaqoob. When he passed away, it came back to me. It's unlike most of my other work and somehow captured some part of him. It suited him and his home office where it hang.

  My father was an accountant. At the height of his corporate career in the early 80's, he was financial controller of South East Asia for Burroughs. He was also a loving husband and father and a wonderful poet too!
